This is a generative patch I made which is inspried by Nathon Ho's works.

I've watched Nathon HO's video on how to make drums, also stole couple of codess of his sound design technique.

Sound Design Implementation:

1.Kick Drum (\kick):

Uses layered FM synthesis with three components
Primary oscillator modulated by two percussive envelopes
Addition of high-frequency noise burst for initial "click"
Tanh distortion for subtle harmonic enhancement
Smart use of envelope modulation ratios (9x and 2x) for drum behavior


2.Snare Drum (\snare):

Complex FM system with self-modulating frequency
Center frequency at 210Hz with 1.6x modulator ratio
Bandpass filtered noise at 3130Hz for characteristic "snap"
Carefully timed envelope shapes for natural decay


3.Clap (\clap):

Multi-band noise generation using specific frequencies (1520, 1200, 1720 Hz)
Microsecond delays (0, 0.01, 0.02) simulate multiple impact events
Uses Splay for stereo width enhancement
Variable decay parameter for flexibility


4.Glitch (\glitch):

Complex harmonic series generation (1..16 harmonics)
Stochastic frequency modulation via LFNoise2
Feedback delay network with pitch shifting
Frequency range modulation from 100Hz to 12kHz
Stereo panning modulation for spatial movement


5.Bass (\bass):

Advanced "moisture bass" technique implementation
Combines sawtooth wave with random octave jumping
Sophisticated filter chain: BHiShelf -> BPF bank -> MoogFF
32-band filter bank for precise spectral shaping
Soft clipping via tanh distortion




Signal Processing:


Strategic use of tanh distortion for harmonic enhancement
Multiple filter types (BPF, HPF, LPF, MoogFF) for spectral shaping
Feedback networks for complex signal interaction
Careful gain staging throughout the signal chain


Effect Processing (\fx):


Real-time pitch shifting with random ratio modulation
Adaptive delay system with noise-modulated delay times
Toggle-based effect switching with smoothing
Parallel processing structure


How to play this project:

Select all the synthdef group which has "add" at the end of line, hold cammand and click return. Then select the routine part, hold shift and click return.
(specific instructions pls see the comments in my project)
