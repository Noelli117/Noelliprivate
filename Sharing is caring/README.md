Uses layered FM synthesis with three components
Primary oscillator modulated by two percussive envelopes
Addition of high-frequency noise burst for initial "click"

Center frequency at 210Hz with 1.6x modulator ratio
Bandpass filtered noise at 3130Hz for characteristic "snap"
Carefully timed envelope shapes for natural decay


3.Clap (\clap):

Multi-band noise generation using specific frequencies (1520, 1200, 1720 Hz)
Microsecond delays (0, 0.01, 0.02) simulate multiple impact events
Uses Splay for stereo width enhancement
Variable decay parameter for flexibility


4.Glitch (\glitch):

Complex harmonic series generation (1..16 harmonics)
Stochastic frequency modulation via LFNoise2

Combines sawtooth wave with random octave jumping
Sophisticated filter chain: BHiShelf -> BPF bank -> MoogFF
32-band filter bank for precise spectral shaping
Soft clipping via tanh distortion




Signal Processing:


Strategic use of tanh distortion for harmonic enhancement

Emergent rhythmic patterns through probability distribution

This code demonstrates advanced understanding of both digital signal processing and electronic music composition techniques. The synthesis methods show careful attention to spectral content and envelope shaping, while the algorithmic composition system creates engaging, non-repetitive patterns. The implementation balances CPU efficiency with sound quality, making it suitable for real-time performance.
